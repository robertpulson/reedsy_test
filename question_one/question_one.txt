My name is Phil Brockwell. I like to challenge myself in all areas of my life, that's why I'm constantly learning. I've recently taken up boxing, as a hobby, and am currently in the process of obtaining my full motorcycle license. I spent the first ten years of my career as a self employed plumber. One day I decided to retire and retrain in computer science, for a career as a programmer. This involved returning to education and emerging with a First Class Honours Degree in Computer Science; my finest achievement to date. This study concluded with a dissertation on Location Tracking Services on mobile devices which found that nearly 60% of subjects surveryed were unaware of the location tracking on their own device. Being a huge fan of dystopian fiction; in particular George Orwell's 1984, I enjoyed great satisfaction in writing this piece. One day I hope to write a similar novel based on the rise, and future, of the popular social media website: Facebook.
