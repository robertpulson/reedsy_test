The most effective way of creating a real-time notification system in a web application is to use the websockets api. Websockets allow a two way connection between the client and server, so data can be sent both ways.
Firstly a websockets connection is established by sending a http request and performing a handshake. Once a connection is active, real-time notifications can be received by creating event listeners which are triggered when a specific message is received from the server. The server is configured to send these messages when new relevant data is added to the database. Once the event is received, the client can be configured to update accordingly, in this case, display the new notification.
