A real time notification is often simulated by setting up ajax requests to periodically poll a server for specific new data. So when new data is added to the db, it will be retrieved by a http get request. Although this method is still used in some modern chat applications, it is not truly real time. 
HTML5 introduced support for the websockets API. Prior to websockets all communication on the web was steered by the client, websockets allow a two way connection between the client and server, so data can be sent both ways; most importantly the server can push new data to the client as soon as it is available.

To use websockets, firstly a connection is established by sending a http request and performing a handshake. Once a connection is active, real-time notifications can be received by creating event listeners which are triggered when a specific message is received from the server. The server is configured to send these messages when new relevant data is added to the database. Once the event is received, the client can be configured to update accordingly, in this case, display the new notification.
